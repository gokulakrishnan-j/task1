HTTP/1.1:

Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web.
HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.
In this process a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST.
In response the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.

Example= https://www.youtube.com/


HTTP/2:

began as the SPDY protocol developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
This protocol served as a template for HTTP/2 when the hypertext transfer protocol working group httpbis of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) put the standard together culminating in the publication of HTTP/2 in May 2015.
From the beginning many browsers supported this standardization effort including Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer, and Safari.
Due in part to this browser support there has been a significant adoption rate of the protocol since 2015 with especially high rates among new sites.

OBJECTS:

objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data of primitive or reference types in the form of “key: value” pairs.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods respectively in the context of an object

Example:

const myCar = {
  make: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  year: 1969
};
console.log(myCar);

Output:
{ make: 'Ford', model: 'Mustang', year: 1969 }
